# school_clock_version1.2
This is an update to the previous clock. The new feature is that I added another .csv file that tells you the period that you are currently in. If I make another update it will hopefully be able to scrape weather data into a .xml file and be able to run responsivley on Android and Ios

In order to run this code it must be executed using the processing IDE or the needed processing libraries must be imported into the main file and the .pde files must be compiled to native java. The name of the folder must be main so when the main file is run the IDE understands to automatically add all of the libraries that are required. Also, another side note is that many aspects of the code work in weird factors of cx and cy. This is because the program is not running properly on processing Ios or Android. I will try to fix this soon to so it can work as an Ios and Android app that is reponsive to all devices it is on.
