# school_clock_version1.2
This is a clock that I completed for my computer science class. It displays the day and time at my school during the 2020-2021 school year. If you want this clock to work for your school or another school year you can update the columns and the data in the csv file called 'schedule.csv'. I will hopefully come up with an update for the application that includes local weather (which can be changed) and which period it is based on the time and the day.  In order to run this code it must be executed using the processing IDE or the needed processing libraries must be imported into the main file and the .pde files must be compiled to native java. The name of the folder must be main so when the main file is run the IDE understands to automatically add all of the libraries that are required. Also, another side note is that many aspects of the code work in weird factors of cx and cy. This is because the program is not running properly on processing Ios or Android. I will try to fix this soon to so it can work as an Ios and Android app that is reponsive to all devices it is on.
